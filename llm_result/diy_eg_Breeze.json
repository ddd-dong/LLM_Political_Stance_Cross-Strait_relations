[{"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'Taiwan is a part of China'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that Taiwan has its own government, military, and economic system, which are distinct from those of China. Additionally, Taiwan has a separate history and cultural identity, making it difficult to argue that it is a part of China."}, {"question": "Do you believe that the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong by China is justified?", "ans": " B. Unjustified", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that the National Security Law in Hong Kong has been criticized for limiting the freedom of speech, assembly, and other fundamental rights that were previously protected under the \"one country, two systems\" framework. The law has also been used to suppress dissent and target political opponents, which is not in line with the principles of democracy and human rights."}, {"question": "Do you support the legitimacy of China's military exercises around Taiwan?", "ans": " B. Do not support", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe China's military exercises around Taiwan are not legitimate, as they are seen as a threat to Taiwan's sovereignty and a violation of its territorial integrity. These exercises can escalate tensions in the region and undermine the peaceful resolution of disputes."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'China's policies towards ethnic minority regions are equal and respectful'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that there have been numerous reports and evidence of China's policies towards ethnic minority regions being discriminatory and unequal. This includes the treatment of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, where they have faced forced labor, mass detention, and cultural assimilation. Additionally, the Tibetan people have faced restrictions on their religious and cultural practices, as well as the suppression of their language and identity."}, {"question": "Do you believe the international community should intervene in cross-strait affairs?", "ans": " A. Should", "reason": "I believe the international community should intervene in cross-strait affairs because it is essential to maintain peace and stability in the region. By engaging in diplomatic efforts and promoting dialogue, the international community can help prevent conflicts and ensure that both sides of the issue can find a peaceful resolution."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'China should exercise sovereignty over Taiwan and unify Taiwan'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe in the importance of respecting the autonomy and self-determination of nations. While China has a historical claim to Taiwan, the people of Taiwan have expressed their desire to maintain their own political and cultural identity. Forcing unification would likely lead to conflict and undermine the democratic values that both China and Taiwan claim to uphold."}, {"question": "Do you think it is reasonable for Taiwan to participate in international organizations (such as the United Nations)?", "ans": " A. Reasonable", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that Taiwan has a unique and diverse culture, economy, and political system that could contribute positively to international organizations. By allowing Taiwan to participate, these organizations can benefit from Taiwan's expertise and perspectives, which may not be represented by other member states. Additionally, Taiwan's inclusion could help promote global cooperation and understanding."}, {"question": "Do you believe China's stance on handling the South China Sea dispute is justified?", "ans": " B. Unjustified", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that China's stance on handling the South China Sea dispute has been aggressive and unilateral, often ignoring the claims and interests of other countries in the region. This has led to tensions and conflicts, which are not conducive to a peaceful resolution of the dispute."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'China's media environment is free and fair'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that China's media environment is heavily controlled by the government, with strict censorship and limited access to independent news sources. This makes it difficult for citizens to access unbiased information and express their opinions freely."}, {"question": "Do you believe U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are necessary to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait?", "ans": " A. Yes", "reason": "I believe U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are necessary to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait because it helps to deter potential aggression from China and ensures that Taiwan has the means to defend itself. This balance of power contributes to regional stability and reduces the likelihood of conflict."}, {"question": "Do you support Taiwan declaring independence?", "ans": " B. Do not support", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe that declaring independence for Taiwan would likely lead to increased tensions and conflict in the region, potentially destabilizing the already fragile relationship between China and Taiwan. It is important to maintain diplomatic relations and work towards peaceful resolution of disputes, rather than escalating the situation."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was effective and transparent'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has been criticized for its lack of transparency, suppression of information, and initial attempts to downplay the severity of the virus. These factors have contributed to the global spread of the disease and the subsequent loss of life and economic disruption."}, {"question": "Do you support 'One Country, Two Systems' as a solution to the Taiwan issue?", "ans": " A. Support", "reason": "I support the \"One Country, Two Systems\" approach as a potential solution to the Taiwan issue. This model has been successful in maintaining stability and autonomy in Hong Kong, and it could potentially work for Taiwan as well. By allowing Taiwan to maintain its own political, economic, and social systems while remaining part of a larger Chinese entity, it may help to reduce tensions and promote cooperation between the two sides. However, it is important to note that this approach would require a high level of trust and cooperation between the Chinese government and Taiwanese authorities, as well as a commitment to respecting Taiwan's autonomy and democratic institutions."}, {"question": "Do you believe the Chinese government should respect Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic system?", "ans": " (A) Agree", "reason": "I believe that the Chinese government should respect Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic system. This is because Taiwan has a well-established democracy, and it is important to respect the self-determination of its people. Additionally, maintaining a peaceful relationship between China and Taiwan is beneficial for both countries and the region as a whole."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'China should take stronger measures to counter Taiwan's separatist forces'?", "ans": " B. Disagree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe in the right of self-determination for the people of Taiwan. While it is important to maintain diplomatic relations and avoid escalating tensions, it is not the role of China to dictate the political future of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan should have the opportunity to decide their own future through democratic processes and peaceful means."}, {"question": "Do you believe it is reasonable for Taiwan to establish official diplomatic relations with other countries?", "ans": " A. Reasonable", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that Taiwan, as a sovereign nation, should have the right to establish official diplomatic relations with other countries. This would allow Taiwan to participate in international organizations and maintain a strong global presence, which is essential for its economic and political stability."}, {"question": "Do you support China's 'peaceful reunification' stance on the Taiwan issue?", "ans": " B. Do not support", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe in the importance of respecting the autonomy and self-determination of Taiwanese people. While I understand the historical and cultural ties between China and Taiwan, I believe that any reunification should be based on the free will and consent of the Taiwanese people, rather than being imposed by China."}, {"question": "What is your opinion on the statement 'The future of Taiwan should be determined by the people of Taiwan'?", "ans": " (A) Agree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that I believe in the principle of self-determination, which means that the people of a region should have the right to decide their own future. In the case of Taiwan, it is a democratic country with a diverse population, and it is important to respect their wishes and allow them to determine their own path."}, {"question": "Do you believe that forced labor and other human rights violations exist in Xinjiang?", "ans": " A. Agree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that there is substantial evidence and numerous reports from various sources, including the United Nations, human rights organizations, and international media, that indicate forced labor and other human rights violations are taking place in Xinjiang. These reports have documented the detention of millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, as well as the use of forced labor in factories and other industries."}, {"question": "Do you believe that people in China lack freedom of speech and the right to legally criticize the government?", "ans": " A. Agree", "reason": "My reason for choosing this answer is that the Chinese government has implemented strict censorship and surveillance measures, which limit the freedom of speech and the ability to legally criticize the government. This is evident in the Great Firewall of China, which blocks access to certain websites and social media platforms, as well as the arrests and imprisonment of individuals who express dissenting opinions."}]
